The https://satolearn.com Wallet Workshop project. A HTML/CSS/JS minimalistic template of a Bitcoin SV wallet under MIT license. 

We encourage users to edit the code, play with settings and variables and extend the functionality and design. 


#### The template contains: 
- Mnemonic Phrase (BIP 39)
- HDPrivateKey
- derivation path selection
- Private Key
- Public Key
- Address
- QR Code 

#### Paperwallet:
Since all JavaScript sources are loaded via file path, the wallet can be used as offline cold wallet. Make sure to save your word phrase to recover the keys, the project itself has no database integrated to store your key.  

#### Demo:
